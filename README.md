## üîê Authentication

- Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Upon successful login, a JWT is set as an HTTP-only cookie.
- Protected routes require a valid JWT in the cookie to access.
- To authenticate, include the JWT in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>


## üóÑÔ∏è Database

- MongoDB is used as the database.
- Ensure MongoDB is running on your system or provide a valid MongoDB URI in the `.env` file.
- The application will create the necessary collections automatically.
